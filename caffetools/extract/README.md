# deep features extraction
Extract deep learning features from images

[(up)](../../README.md)

## quick start
This quick start will let you extract deep features from an image into a text file using Googlenet.

1. `cd` into `$ROOT`
2. create `config.json` (if not yet done) and fill out the appropriate paths and settings (use `config.json.template` as a guide)
3. run `python extract_features.py /path/to/image.jpg /path/to/output/features.txt`
